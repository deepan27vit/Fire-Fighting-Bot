# Fire-Fighting-Bot
This project is an Arduino-based Fire &amp; Smoke Detection System designed to detect early signs of fire using gas/smoke sensors and trigger an instant alarm to ensure safety. It provides real-time monitoring, quick response alerts, and can be extended with IoT platforms for remote notifications.

Accurate Fire Detection using Flame Sensor

 Smoke/Gas Detection using MQ-2 Sensor

 High-volume Buzzer Alarm for emergency alerts

 Status Indicator LEDs for Normal, Warning & Danger states

 Fast response time

 Beginner-friendly Arduino implementation

 Optional: IoT integration (Blynk / ESP32 / ThinkSpeak)

Components Used

Arduino UNO (or compatible board)

MQ-2 Smoke/Gas Sensor

Flame Sensor

Buzzer

Red & Green LEDs

Working Principle

The MQ-2 sensor continuously monitors smoke, LPG, methane, and flammable gases.

The Flame sensor detects infrared light emitted by flames.

If smoke or fire level crosses a threshold, the system:

Activates buzzer alarm

Switches LED status to Red

Sends optional IoT alert (if integrated)

In normal conditions, the system stays in monitoring mode with a green indicator.
